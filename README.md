### Gear Guru Smart AI Bot for Startup Business

**Gear Guru Smart AI Bot** is an affordable, customizable chatbot solution designed to enhance customer support for small businesses and startups. Built using the **Botpress AI Agent Tool** and integrated within a web interface crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this chatbot serves as a comprehensive assistant for business owners. The bot is specifically tailored to answer customer inquiries, manage appointment scheduling, and provide location-based service pricing. It offers key features such as customized responses, emergency assistance, and promotional notifications, making it accessible for businesses of all sizes.

Our initial prototype is implemented for **M.S. Car Zone**, a premier car service provider, but the chatbot can be easily adapted for other industries. The project focuses on delivering quality customer interaction at a low cost, ensuring small business owners can improve their service offerings without a heavy investment.
